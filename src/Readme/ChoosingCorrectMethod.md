**Choosing the Right Method: Lifting State Up vs. useLocation**

The choice between lifting state up and using `useLocation` depends on the specific use case and the complexity of your application.

**Lifting State Up:**

* **Best for:** Simple scenarios where you need to share data between a few components within a hierarchy.
* **Pros:**
  - Clear data flow.
  - Easier to understand and maintain.
  - No need for additional libraries or hooks.
* **Cons:**
  - Can lead to prop drilling, especially in deeply nested component structures.
  - Might not be suitable for large-scale applications with complex state management.

**useLocation:**

* **Best for:** Sharing data between routes, especially when you need to pass data from one route to another.
* **Pros:**
  - Convenient for passing data between routes.
  - No need to lift state up multiple levels.
* **Cons:**
  - Might not be suitable for sharing data within a single route, especially if the data needs to be accessed by multiple components.
  - Can introduce complexity if overused.

**In your specific case, where you want to display data from a previous route on the current route, `useLocation` is a good choice.** It allows you to access the data that was passed as part of the navigation state.

**However, if you need to share data between multiple components within the same route and the data is not specific to a particular route, lifting state up is a better option.**

**Additional Considerations:**

- **State Management Libraries:** For complex state management scenarios, consider using a state management library like Redux or Zustand.
- **Performance:** Be mindful of performance implications, especially when dealing with large datasets or frequent state updates.
- **Code Readability:** Choose the approach that makes your code more readable and maintainable.

By carefully considering these factors, you can make informed decisions about how to share data between components in your React applications.
