**Yes, you're absolutely right!** Lifting state up is another effective way to share data between components, especially when the data needs to be accessed by multiple components.

**Here's how you can do it:**

1. **Lift State to a Common Parent:**
   - Identify the common parent component of both `SearchPage` and `ResultsPage`.
   - Declare the `searchQuery` and `fetchedData` state in this parent component.
   - Pass these state values as props to both `SearchPage` and `ResultsPage`.

2. **Update the Components:**

   **SearchPage:**
   ```javascript
   const SearchPage = ({ onSearch, fetchedData }) => {
     // ... (rest of the component)

     const handleSubmit = (e) => {
       // ... (handle search query and fetch data)
       onSearch(searchQuery, fetchedData);
     };
   };
   ```

   **ResultsPage:**
   ```javascript
   const ResultsPage = ({ fetchedData }) => {
     // ... (display fetchedData)
   };
   ```

**Advantages of Lifting State Up:**

- **Clearer Data Flow:** The data flow is more straightforward, and it's easier to understand how data is being shared.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Avoids the need for Context API or routing state.
- **Better Performance:** In some cases, it can lead to better performance as there's less overhead in updating state.

**However, consider these points:**

- **Prop Drilling:** If you have many levels of nested components, prop drilling can become cumbersome.
- **Complex State Management:** For complex state management scenarios, Context API or a state management library like Redux might be more suitable.

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

The best approach depends on the specific use case and the complexity of your application. If you have a simple scenario with a few components, lifting state up is often a good choice. For more complex scenarios, consider using Context API or a state management library.

By carefully considering these factors, you can make informed decisions about how to share data between components in your React applications.
